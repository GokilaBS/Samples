# HelloWorld Sample
The Hello World sample provides simple COBOL & PL/I programs and the Gr oovy build scripts to compile them to show the simplest form of using DBB to build z/OS programs.  In order to keep the build scripts as simple as possible, hard coded values are used and need to be changed in order for the script to run on your system.
